- regression image - 

write  tests  before

write the tests
test the tests: run the tests, they should fail
    and fail in the right way
develop
run
develop
run

also several test / dev cycles could happen, just keep in mind to revert the
traditional order

- towards declarative
- towards literate

bug -> fix -- no
bug -> test -> fix -- yes

advantage? regression

- cross fire -

- regression image - 

regression tests relief you code by a task: to be similar to itself

everything is based on an extremely simple principle:

write  tests  before

write the tests
test the tests: run the tests, they should fail
    and fail in the right way
develop
run
develop
run

--
    important benefit: "what do we want"? first of all
--
    for the lazy:

    expect('')

    let the tests write themselves
--

also several test / dev cycles could happen, just keep in mind to revert the
traditional order

- towards declarative
- towards literate

bug -> fix -- no
bug -> test -> fix -- yes

advantage? regression
